## Section 3 - Validation
- ### DTD File
![Book_database DTD](/screenshots/bookdbDTD.png)

This Document Type Definition (DTD) describes the structure of an XML document for a list of books.

1. `<!ELEMENT books (book+)>`: This line means that the root element of the document is `<books>`. Inside this element, there must be one or more `<book>` elements (as indicated by the `+` symbol).

2. `<!ELEMENT book (title, author, year, ibsn, price, stock, sold, notes?)>`: This line defines the structure of each `<book>` element. A `<book>` element must contain the child elements `<title>`, `<author>`, `<year>`, `<ibsn>`, `<price>`, `<stock>`, and `<sold>` in the exact order as specified. The `<notes>` child element is optional (as indicated by the `?` symbol).

3. `<!ELEMENT title (#PCDATA)>`, `<!ELEMENT author (#PCDATA)>`, `<!ELEMENT year (#PCDATA)>`, `<!ELEMENT ibsn (#PCDATA)>`, `<!ELEMENT price (#PCDATA)>`, `<!ELEMENT stock (#PCDATA)>`, `<!ELEMENT sold (#PCDATA)>`: These lines mean that the `<title>`, `<author>`, `<year>`, `<ibsn>`, `<price>`, `<stock>`, and `<sold>` elements must contain parsed character data (`#PCDATA`), i.e., text.

4. `<!ELEMENT notes EMPTY>`: This line indicates that the `<notes>` element should not contain any text or other elementsâ€”it must be empty.

5. `<!ATTLIST book id ID #REQUIRED>`: This line states that each `<book>` element must have an `id` attribute of type ID (which means that it must be a unique identifier within the document), and that this attribute is required.

6. `<!ATTLIST book lang NMTOKEN "en">`: This line defines an attribute `lang` for the `<book>` element. The value of `lang` should be a name token (NMTOKEN), which means it must be a valid XML name. If no `lang` is provided, the default value will be `"en"`.
   
By using this DTD, an XML document of books can be validated to ensure it adheres to the defined structure and content model.
